Question Quest global interview:

Take an input of size of array N, Then take the input for all the elements.
display 1st half of the array sorted from ascending to decending.
then display 2half of the array sorted from decending to ascending.


Limitation:
No STL to be used
No nested loop should be used
To display the output if loop is used then it should be a single loop
